# Begin Figure

### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| -    | -    | -           |

This is the first element of a _closed_ figure.

All subsequent elements until the next [End Figure](figure.md#end-figure)
will be part of this closed figure.

# End Figure

### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| -    | -    | -           |

This element terminates the current closed figure.

If the current region has not yet been closed by a preceding NEW REGION element and if the last point of
the last line element is not coincident with the current closure point, then the current subregion is closed
by a line segment connecting the last point of the preceding line element to the current closure point. This
line becomes a part of the implicit boundary specification.

If the **End Figure** was preceded by a
CONNECTING EDGE element, which was itself preceded by a line primitive, then this line also becomes
part of the edge specification. If the region which has been previously closed is empty, or if the last point
of the last line element is coincident with the current closure point, or if the last element was a filled-area
primitive, then no line segment is generated by this element.
